# Calculator Project

## Description
This is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and more. It supports the use of both keyboard and mouse inputs for a better user experience. The project was developed to demonstrate the implementation of arithmetic operations with proper precedence, error handling, and clean user interface design.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), division (÷), modulus (%), and more.
- **Keyboard and Mouse Input**: Allows users to interact with the calculator using either their keyboard or mouse.
- **Order of Operations**: Handles operator precedence correctly (PEMDAS: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction).
- **Clear and Reset**: Includes a clear button (C) to reset the input and an AC (All Clear) to clear everything.
- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to structure the content and layout of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the calculator and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic of the calculator, including the arithmetic operations and order of precedence.

## How to Use
1. Click on the calculator buttons or type numbers and operators using your keyboard.
2. The result will be displayed on the screen as you enter the operations.
3. Press "C" to clear the current input or "AC" to reset the calculator.
4. For complex operations, input expressions with correct order of operations, and the calculator will return the correct result.

## Example Operations
- **Addition**: `2 + 2 = 4`
- **Multiplication**: `3 × 4 = 12`
- **Division**: `6 ÷ 2 = 3`
- **Modulo**: `10 % 3 = 1`
- **Complex Expressions**: `(5 + 3) × 2 = 16`
